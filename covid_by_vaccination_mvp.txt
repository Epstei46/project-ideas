A specific question or set of questions to answer or a theory to test using data analysis:
    How much of a difference does Covid vaccination make in regards to case/hospitalization/death rates?

A purpose behind the question - why does this matter:
    The pharmaceutical companies have already published studies on the efficacy of their vaccines.
    However, the state of California has a much larger data set and less/no conflicts of interest,
    so the data coming from there is more reputable. Anyone who has not yet been vaccinated due to a distrust
    in Big Pharma may be more willing to consider the vaccine after seeing this more reputable data.

Choose at least 2 data sources - can be static datasets, live data, APIs, or other:
    For California, daily cases/deaths/hospitalization by vaccination status
    <https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data>
    Outdated <https://data.world/chhs/e39edc8e-9db1-40a7-9e87-89169401c3f5>

Propose 2-3 visual elements you will include in your analysis (charts, visualizations, etc.):
    --  3 Charts. 1 for Cases, 1 for Hospitilizations, 1 for Deaths.
        2 different lines. 1 for vaccinated, 1 for unvaccinated.
        y-axis as numeric count, x-axis as time (days/weeks/months)
    --  May consider similar tables but with y-axis converted to rates (per 100,000?).
        Rates actually makes more sense, so would be good to calculate that.

 UPDATE -- scrapping this idea. Can only get cleaned data sets under 1000 rows, not much analysis I can do that they already didn't do on the website. Only large dataset I could find only had rates per 100,000, not the actual numbers. Too difficult to get the actual data.
 
 A specific question or set of questions to answer or a theory to test using data analysis:
    Does Covid vaccination make a reasonable difference in regards to case/death/hospitalization rates?
    Can we look at vaccination rate vs daily/weekly frequency of new cases?
    Across different countries?

A purpose behind the question - why does this matter:


Choose at least 2 data sources - can be static datasets, live data, APIs, or other:
    Rates of COVID-19 Cases or Deaths by Week AND Age Group, showing Vaccination Status
    <https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/3rge-nu2a>
    Hospitilization rates for USA by vaccination status <https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination>
    Maybe? Vaccination rates per state <https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total>
    More hospitilzation rates, but nothing else <https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/COVIDNet/COVID19_3.html>

Propose 2-3 visual elements you will include in your analysis (charts, visualizations, etc.):

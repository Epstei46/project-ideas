-- Working on exercise at https://ed.devmountain.com/materials/data-bp-1/exercises/capstone-ideas-data/

-- Generate at least 5 compelling project ideas for data analysis projects you would like to create. The project should have a research question (or set of questions), multiple datasets, statistical analysis, and visualizations.
-- During this stage, your “idea” can be fairly general and informal. You don’t need to provide a lot of detail for each idea– a single bullet point for each idea should be sufficient.

Tips: Make a list of hobbies and interests, and then use that to structure your brainstorming OR Make a list of daily activities, and then use that to structure your brainstorming OR Make a list of problems you would like to solve OR Ask a friend or family member for major questions they have that could be answered with data OR Go search on the internet for data projects and get inspiration from others’ work

(1)  Does Covid vaccination make a reasonable difference in regards to death/hospitality rate? Across different countries? Can we look at vaccination rate vs daily/weekly frequency of new cases? <https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Rates-of-COVID-19-Cases-or-Deaths-by-Age-Group-and/3rge-nu2a> Also cases/deaths/hospitalizations by vaccination status, 2 data sets <https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status>

(2) Can pull data from <https://population.un.org/wpp/> & in Interactive Data, look at population, fertility, mortality, migration, dependency rations. Can only select one specific one at a time, & can compare groups or specific countries (through SDG Regions). Or I can also go Data => Data Sources => Data Download: Metadata. Can look at rate change over the years or compare places. 

(3) <https://data.world/health/chsi-to-combat-obesity> Has those fips_code that were used in a previous exercise. Includes these tables: healthypeople2010 & demographics & leadingcausesofdeath & summarymeasuresofhealth & measuresofbirthanddeath & relativehealthimportance & vunerablepopsandenvhealth & preventiveservicesuse & riskfactorsandaccesstocare

 A specific question or set of questions to answer or a theory to test using data analysis:
    Checking to see if there was a variation in the incidence of Covid cases/deaths by state.

A purpose behind the question - why does this matter:
    If there is a significant different between states, then it is important to look further into the states with the
    lowest incidence vs highest incidence to get a better understanding of why. Could look at vaccination rates,
    urban vs rural, specific policy, survey samples of the population about wearing masks, etc.
    This could be useful for current policy, and future policy if another pandemic occurs.

Choose at least 2 data sources - can be static datasets, live data, APIs, or other:
    Can download 3 datasets by county and date: cases, deaths, population. But no vaccination data.

Propose 2-3 visual elements you will include in your analysis (charts, visualizations, etc.):
    Could have a graph showing cases and deaths, by month or most recent ~8 weeks. For country or some states.
        - If the line graph is for the country, separate lines for cases/deaths, y-axis total & x-axis time.
        - If the line graph is for states, maybe one graph for cases and one graph for deaths, different colors for
        each state (some of the best and worst, not every state). y-axis total & x-axis time.
        - If the bar graph is for states, would be cool if I can get 1 state per bar, each bar including both cases
        and deaths. Deaths would be considered a subset of cases, so they would not be added together for a total
        count. If there are 100 cases and 10 deaths, the total would be 100, 90% of the bar would be red (cases)
        and 10% of the bar would be black (deaths). Have a total for each state for a certain amount of time,
        y-axis total & x-axis states.
